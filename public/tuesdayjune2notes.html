Arrays are met to use loops to travers
The most basic simpliest loop we have is a while loope EX:
	var i = 0;
	while (i < data.length) {
	console.log(data.list[i]);
	i++; you have to remember to increment i.
}
The next loop is the for loop EX:
for (var i = 0; i < data.list.length; i++) {
	console.log(data.list[i]);
}
the pros and cons to much things can be forgotten for loops are more like a fill in the blank all the same pieces as the while loop just moved them around. 

The next loop is .foreach EX:
data.list.forEach(function (dayilyForecast) { 
	console.log(day);
	
});
	is the best is the .forEach loop. 
	the downside is that you can only use it to scan thru arrays

The last loop is a loop using jQuery
$(data.list).each(function (index, day) {
	console.log(day)
});	
The downside is that you need jQUERY library
You have to add two parameter to work
